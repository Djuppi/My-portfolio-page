                    <p>The beginning of my journey with Html and basic Css dates back to 2014, where I was “hired” as a voluntary, at the local Beachvolleyclub, as a website editor. Back then I had little experience with websites, but took the opportunity to learn some new skills. The website was already created, and my job was to add new pages with information about new training hours and articles. At Academy I've developed more advanced skills in Html and especially Css.</p>
